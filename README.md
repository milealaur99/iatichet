## Technology Stack & Security üîß

### Frontend Technologies üì¶

The frontend is built with React and various libraries to ensure a responsive, interactive, and consistent UI:

- **@emotion/react & @emotion/styled**: Component-based styling for a polished, cohesive UI.
- **@mui/material & @mui/icons-material**: Provides a consistent design with pre-styled components and icons.
- **@reduxjs/toolkit & react-redux**: Manages global state for seamless data handling, especially for user sessions and reservations.
- **React Router DOM**: Enables smooth, multi-page navigation.
- **Axios**: Facilitates efficient data exchange with the backend.
- **React Query**: Manages data caching and synchronization, reducing load times.
- **Socket.io Client**: Provides real-time updates for a dynamic, interactive user experience.
- **Testing Libraries (Jest, React Testing Library)**: Ensures components function correctly, enhancing reliability.

### Backend Security Measures üõ°Ô∏è

*iaTichet.com* integrates multiple security layers to protect user data and application integrity:

- **Helmet**: Protects against **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**, **clickjacking**, and **MIME sniffing** by securing HTTP headers.
- **Express Rate Limit**: Defends against **DDoS** and **brute-force attacks** by limiting request rates.
- **CSRF Protection (CSURF)**: Prevents **Cross-Site Request Forgery** by requiring a unique token for sensitive requests.
- **CORS Policy**: Blocks unauthorized cross-origin requests, enhancing protection against **XSS**.
- **Session Management with Secure Cookies**: Defends against **session hijacking** with HTTP-only, secure cookies.
- **Sentry Error Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of errors and security incidents for fast response.

Together, these measures protect against **XSS, CSRF, DDoS, brute-force attacks, session hijacking,** and **clickjacking**, providing a secure and reliable experience for all users.

## Caching Strategy üöÄ

To improve response times and reduce server load, **Redis** is used for efficient caching:

1. **Redis Client Setup with Error Handling**: Ensures reliable caching operations with error detection.
2. **Custom Caching Functions**:
   - `getAsync`: Retrieves cached data in binary format, optimized for fast access.
   - `setAsync`: Stores data with a 1-hour TTL, balancing data freshness and efficiency.
3. **User Activity Tracking**:
   - The `timeoutStorage` and `usersViewingEvent` maps track user sessions, optimizing caching based on active users.

This caching strategy enhances application performance by delivering quick response times and reducing repeated data queries, resulting in a smooth, high-performance experience.

---

## Configuration & Deployment Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

The application is containerized with **Docker Compose**, enabling consistent deployment across environments. Key services include:

- **Frontend Service**: Runs on port 3000, configured to interface with the backend.
- **Backend Service**: Hosted on port 5000, with health checks for uptime and readiness.
- **Ngrok Service**: Provides a secure, temporary public URL, facilitating webhook testing and external integrations.
- **MongoDB & Redis**: MongoDB serves as the main data storage, while Redis handles caching. Both have persistent volumes for data retention.

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

A GitHub Actions pipeline automates deployment and updates for *iaTichet.com*:

1. **Docker Compose Setup**: Installs and initializes services with Docker Compose.
2. **Ngrok Tunnel Setup**: Establishes a public URL for backend testing.
3. **Dynamic Environment Updates**: Syncs the latest Ngrok URL in `.env`, allowing frontend-backend alignment.
4. **Render.com Deployment Trigger**: Deploys the application with the latest environment settings for seamless live updates.

This pipeline streamlines deployment, ensuring that *iaTichet.com* remains accessible and up-to-date.

## Future Plans: AWS Implementation üåê

To expand *iaTichet.com* and leverage the scalability, security, and reliability of cloud infrastructure, I plan to deploy the application on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. This implementation will enhance the application‚Äôs performance, improve data management, and provide a scalable solution to accommodate growing user demand. Below are the AWS services intended for use, each selected to support specific aspects of the application.

### AWS Services for Hosting & Scaling

1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**:  
   EC2 will provide resizable compute capacity, allowing the backend to scale seamlessly with user traffic. By launching instances as needed, EC2 ensures that the backend remains highly available, supporting *iaTichet.com* during peak usage.

2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**:  
   S3 will serve as the storage solution for static assets, such as user-uploaded images, PDFs, and other media. This service offers secure, low-latency access to files, and lifecycle policies can be applied to manage storage costs effectively as data grows.

3. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**:  
   RDS will simplify database management with a managed solution, supporting either MongoDB compatibility (via Amazon DocumentDB) or PostgreSQL to store reservation and user data securely. RDS offers automated backups, scaling options, and maintenance, enhancing reliability and performance.

4. **Amazon ElastiCache**:  
   For improved caching, ElastiCache with Redis will be implemented to reduce database load and improve response times by storing frequently accessed data in-memory.

5. **Amazon API Gateway**:  
   API Gateway will enable secure and scalable API management, controlling traffic to the backend and enforcing rate limits. Its integration with other AWS services will provide an additional security layer for exposed endpoints.

6. **AWS Lambda (Serverless Functions)**:  
   Lambda functions will handle background tasks, such as sending notifications or generating QR codes, in a scalable, serverless environment. This approach keeps resource costs low for event-driven tasks, enhancing efficiency.

7. **AWS CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)**:  
   CloudFront will distribute static content globally, caching assets stored in S3 closer to users and reducing load times for a smoother user experience.
